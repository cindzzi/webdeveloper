# webdeveloper
This repository is for my The Web Developer Bootcamp that I am doing online at udemy.com
This is a 47h online bootcamp for all levels, and includes HTML, CSS, JS, NODE and much More! I already have some knowledge in 
web developement due to the 6 month in class data analytics bootcamp that I did in Rice University. 
The reason I am taking this bootcamp is because I really enjoyed doing web pages so I decided to learn more during my 
quaratine time. 
I will put all the assignments solutions that I am going to do and also a note saying how I did on it.
